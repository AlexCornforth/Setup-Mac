# Setup-Mac
A script to setup a new Mac with everything I need.

Includes tools, apps and default settings.

## Usage:
 * Run `./setup.sh`
 * Enter password when prompted
 * Now you have gained some **free time**:
    * **Enjoy** a coffee (in a reusable cup please)
    * Go for a **brisk** walk
    * Make a **friend** at your (potentially) new job
 * Finished, your Mac is just how you like it
 * Now do some work
 * Remember, **automate** all the things

###### Note:
*This is how I like my Mac setup and these are the tools and apps I use. Feel free to fork this and edit the script to reflect how you like your own Mac.*
